# Feature Manipulation Engine - What and How!

## Introduction To FME:

In the world of Spatial data, the continuous increase in the
amount of data to be analyzed and manipulated has become a 
sea of trouble as the time involved in such processes has become
an important factor when it comes to a bulk data analysis.

## What is FME?
For those who would like to spend more time extracting value out of your data rather than fighting it and 
without needing to code anything, FME which is also known as the Feature Manipulation 
Engine is the best bet!

## How it works?
FME works on the principle of Connect your sources -> Transform your Data-> Automate the entire workflow!

## An Example:
What would you do If you have district boundary for entire India, the point data consisting 
of the house locations and you want to find number of houses per district and remember, 
this is huge amount of data which you are about to process! Yes, there are several GIS tools 
and programming languages which could give you the result but at the cost of your time! Here 
is the simple FME work flow which could give you the results in minutes!
