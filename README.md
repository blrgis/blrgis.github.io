Welcome to BlrGIS community blog

# About

BlrGIS is a group of people who want to create an easily accessible Geographic Information System resources for the community to use.
These articles are written as a part of our learning process for all of these GIS concepts, so if there are any room for improvement please provide your feedback.

# Purpose

This space is for scribbling our thoughts and concepts that could be used for some projects or for any DIY tasks related to Remote Sensing or GIS. We meet once a month to discuss anything related to our career and set out commitments that we'll do before the next meeting. This way, we will keep track of all the work that we do and it will be a source of documents and projects that could be useful later.
