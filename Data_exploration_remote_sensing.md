# Remote Sensing Data Exploration

For any data science project, understanding and handling the data is the key. Images are big part of RS data (other type of RS data may include signals from spectrometer or radiometer, lidar point cloud, etc.). In this article, we will learn how to handle and understand the remote sensing (hereon reffered as RS) data in particular, images. 

There are lot of satellites that collect the RS data, here we will use the data from [LANDSAT](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/) satellite which is freely available and can be downloaded from [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). Say you want to download data for Bangalore, in the search criteria you need to either give the address or if you know the latitude longitude co-ordinates you can enter those. Once you select the dates for which time period you want to download the data, click on datasets button to get the list of satellitesto select.
